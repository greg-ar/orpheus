All you have to do is create a token to a discord bot and then put that token on the first line
of a new file called "token.txt" in the "token" folder


Dependencies: nextcord, youtube_dl, ffmpeg, pynacl


Run it with by executing the start.sh script


For now it has only the bare down minimun functionality for a music bot.
